# 559. Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

**Example 1:**

    **Input:** `nums = [4,2,3], k = 1`  
    **Output:** `5`  

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** `nums = [3,-1,0,2], k = 3`  
    **Output:** `6`  

**Constraints:**  
    `The total number of nodes is in the range [0, 10**4].`  
    `The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.`
