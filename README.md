# LeetCode Problems Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for various problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). You can also visit my LeetCode profile [here](https://leetcode.com/u/DeanLogan/)

## Structure

Each problem has its own directory, named after the problem's title. Inside each directory, you'll find a file with the solution code, as well as a README file that has the problem description and a png of the runtime and memory usage of the solution.

## Usage 

To run a solution, enter the folder (problems name) followed by `solution.go` command. For example:

```sh
go run ./contains-duplicate/solution.go
```

Or

```sh
go run ./k-frequency/solution.go
